Put this package in your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory to get syntax highlighting
and build system integration of .bsdoc documents.

Note: The syntax highlighting does not use the "proper" Sublime Text 2 markup tags.
(markup.heading.1, etc) because they were not sufficiently distinct in the default
color theme. And I didn't have patience enough to create a new color theme.

The build system is setup to run the .bsdoc file through a _make.rb program in the
files directory. See the Samples directory for samples of what a _make.rb program
might look like.
